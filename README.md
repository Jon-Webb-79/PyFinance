Purpose: This program reads in the files "Input.txt", "Bar.txt", "Gas.txt",
         "Groceries.txt", "Misc.txt", and "Rest.txt".  Frome these files,
         the computer develops a cummulative density function for personal
         spending in the areas of alcohol consumption, automotive gas, 
         groceries, restaurants and miscellaneous spending.  This information
         along with planned large expenses and tax information stored in "Input.txt"
         are used to determine the estimate of capital in the checking and savings
         account at any time within the range of user specified dates.
